# 7LittleWords
A .NET command line solver for 7 Little Words

## Disclaimer

Don't expect much from this. It was written in an hour or two because I was frustrated at a 7LittleWords puzzle (http://www.7littlewords.com/daily-puzzle/)

I don't profess that I chose the most efficient way to solve these puzzles, I merely chose the fastest way for me to write it.

## Usage

Run the executable. 

1. Type in each of the 20 word pieces, hitting return between each piece. After, hit enter (with a blank line).
1. Type in the length of a word. Words longer than 11 or 12 take a while. It may not find some words, such as proper nouns, or weird uncommon words, like "bewhiskered". It will print a list of words that can be made with those letters.
1. If you're having trouble finding an answer with only 4 or 5 characters (there can be a lot), then complete some longer words first. If you type a solved word instead of a length, it will eliminate the used tiles and you'll have fewer solutions to sift through for the rest of the words.
